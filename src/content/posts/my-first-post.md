# My first post

**written** **in** `markdown` with ❤️

I keep putting of finishing and writing to the blog I decided to make using svelte...
So why not just start with a in between starting point, so I can fix the things I dont like as I go!

## Why astro?

Because I like to change out what I do to learn new things. Using astro will let me include
svelte, vue and what ever next thing I want to learn.

## Why blog?

Because it I belive its in the middle ground of writing a newspaper, and a wiki.
I can write what I mean, but still make it riddles with spelling mistakes.

## Why now?

I have been putting it of for way to long. My main goal is to try to express my hobbies,
goals and things I like to do. So creating software, self hosting, and trying to make it work in kuberneters. xD

## Who are you?

Well, hopefully I will write more, so you know who I am!
For now, all you need to know, is that you can call me [Benmi](https://www.benmi.me/)
